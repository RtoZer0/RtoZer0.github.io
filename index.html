        <h3 style="color:crimson;">First of all, I like to play piano.</h3>
        <p style="color:rgb(61, 12, 12)">I've been playing piano since I was 8, (It basically means I've been playing it for 6 years) and 
              It's just amazing everytime I play it. Learning new musics are always some hard challenges for me, 
               but after finally becoming able to play the music I wanted to play, makes me feel determined to learn more and more. <br>
               <br>

<h2 style="color:crimson;">Reading</2>
<h4><center>Wise man once said, "Today a reader, tomorrow a leader."</center></h4>
<p><center>It's always great to read when you find the right book. Novel, sci-fi, etc. Reading, and learning new stuff while taking a great aesthetic feeling... Definitely my type!</center> <br>
<center>/Even though I only read books to make myself feel sleepy <b>:P</b>/</center></p>
